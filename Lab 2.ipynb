    "In this lab, I looked at data from the World Bank on countries' percentage of nuclear and alternative energy use compared to their total energy use. The average percentage and the minimum and maximum percentages were found for the years 2011 and 2012. It was found that Iceland uses the most alternative and/or nuclear energy with over 89% of its energy use being comprised of these sources. The minimum percentages were both zero and the average for both 2011 and 2012 were over eight percent. "

    "This data was accessed through the World Bank website, which can be found here: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.USE.COMM.CL.ZS?view=chart. The data itself came from the International Energy Agency and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Here is the original CSV file: API_EG.USE.COMM.CL.ZS_DS2_en_csv_v2_10082393.csv. This data represents the percentage of nuclear and alternative energy use. So, if half of a country's energy production came from a nuclear or alternative source then its percentaeg would be 50. Note that this figure does not take into consideration the volume of energy production. For example, if the country with half of its energy coming form nuclear or alternative sources is Country A and a country with a quarter of its energy coming from those sources is Country B, then Country A's percentage will be 50 to B's 25. However Country B may produce two times as much energy as A, so while B's percentage is half that of A's, the energy outpute is equal.  \n",

    "It was found that the maximum percenatges for 2011 and 2012 were 89.73% and 89.64% (rounded); both of these figures were out of Iceland. The minimum percentages were both 0.0, and one of the countries that produced no alternative or nuclear energy was the UAE. The average nuclear and alternative energy percentage for 2011 and 2012 was 8.72% and 8.79%, respectively. One area for further exploration are the factors that go into how much a nation invests in nuclear and alternative energy. If a country has strong oil reserves, it might not seem beneficial to use other sources of energy. Additonally, some countries are well positioned to use these other sources. For example Iceland, with the high nuclear and alternative energy percentages at over 89%, has a population of only a few hundred thousand and about 90% of its households use geothermal energy according to the UN (https://unchronicle.un.org/article/iceland-s-sustainable-energy-story-model-world); it would be interesting to see this data broken down by the specific source of energy. The average of just under nine percent is interesting, but becuase the amount of energy produced is not taken into account, the two figures do not completely address questions of widespread usage of nuclear and alternative energy sources. This is becuase of the nature of climate change. If a quarter of a superpower's energy comes from nuclear or alternative sources but the other 75% still comes from fossil fuels, more environmental damage is done than a country that has a percentage of ten but produces so much less energy it doesn't matter. On the other hand, this data indicates how much is being invested into cleaner sources of energy, and that creates immidiate posotive effects in terms of climate change. One more area for further exploration are the factors that contribute to the slight increases and decreases (not to mention the dramatic ones) from year to year. For example the average percentage increased slightly from 2011 to 2012. What event or events caused this?"

    "Ms. Sconyers provided me with all of the code present in both data preparation and modeling. A thanks to the International Energy Agency, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the Wolrd Bank for collecting and publishing this data (this data was published by the World Bank but it is owned by the IEA and OECD). Also, the United Nations provided information on Iceland's energy production that assisted in analysis.     "
